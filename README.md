# Conway's Game of Life Implementation

## 🎮 How the Game Works

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that evolves based on simple rules:

### Rules of the Game:
- **Any live cell** with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next generation
- **Any dead cell** with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)
- **All other cells** die or remain dead in the next generation

The simulation runs on an infinite two-dimensional grid where each cell interacts with its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

## 🕹️ How to Use the Application

### Controls Overview:

#### 🎯 **Random Button**
- **Purpose**: Populates the grid with random live cells (approximately 30% density)
- **When to use**: Click **before starting** to create an initial random configuration
- **Effect**: Stops any running simulation and generates a new random pattern

#### ▶️ **Start Button**
- **Purpose**: Begins the continuous simulation
- **When to use**: After setting up your initial pattern (via Random or manual drawing)
- **Note**: Becomes disabled while simulation is running

#### ⏹️ **Stop Button**
- **Purpose**: Pauses the running simulation
- **When to use**: To pause and examine the current generation
- **Note**: Only enabled when simulation is active

#### ⏭️ **Step Button**
- **Purpose**: Advances the simulation by exactly one generation
- **When to use**: For precise control and observation of each generation
- **Note**: Only available when simulation is paused

#### 🧹 **Clear Button**
- **Purpose**: Resets the entire grid to all dead cells
- **When to use**: To start fresh with a clean grid
- **Effect**: Stops simulation and clears all cells

#### 🎚️ **Speed Slider**
- **Purpose**: Controls the simulation speed
- **Range**: From **Fast** (left) to **Slow** (right)
- **Real-time adjustment**: Can be changed during simulation

### 🖱️ Manual Cell Editing:
- **Click** on any cell to toggle its state (alive/dead)
- **Click and drag** to draw multiple cells
- Works even while simulation is running for interactive experimentation

## 🎨 Predefined Patterns

The application includes several famous Game of Life patterns:

### **Glider**
- A spaceship that moves diagonally across the grid
- Select from Patterns → Glider menu

### **Blinker**
- An oscillator that alternates between horizontal and vertical states
- Period 2 oscillator

### **Pulsar**
- A complex period 3 oscillator with fascinating behavior
- One of the most well-known patterns in Game of Life

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Core Components:**

#### 1. `CellState.java` - Data Model
```java
public enum CellState {
    ALIVE,   // Represents a living cell
    DEAD     // Represents a dead/empty cell
}
```
- **Purpose**: Simple enum defining the two possible states of a cell
- **Role**: Foundation for the entire simulation's data representation

#### 2. `Grid.java` - Business Logic Layer
```java
public class Grid {
    // Handles all game rules and grid operations
    public void nextGeneration() { ... }
    private int countLiveNeighbors(int x, int y) { ... }
    public void setCell(int x, int y, CellState state) { ... }
    // ... other core methods
}
```
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implements Conway's Game of Life rules
  - Manages cell states and neighbor calculations
  - Handles toroidal boundary conditions (wrapping edges)
  - Provides pattern generation (glider, blinker, pulsar)

#### 3. `GameOfLife.java` - Application Controller
```java
public class GameOfLife {
    // Manages simulation flow and timing
    public void start() { ... }
    public void stop() { ... }
    public void step() { ... }
    // ... simulation control methods
}
```
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Main application entry point
  - Simulation thread management
  - Generation timing and pacing
  - Coordination between grid and UI

#### 4. `GameOfLifeUI.java` - Presentation Layer
```java
public class GameOfLifeUI extends JFrame {
    // Swing-based user interface
    private class GridPanel extends JPanel { ... }
    // ... UI components and event handlers
}
```
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Graphical rendering of the grid
  - User interaction handling (clicks, drags, buttons)
  - Control panel management
  - Real-time visualization updates

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User Interaction** → `GameOfLifeUI` handles input events
2. **UI Commands** → `GameOfLife` controller processes requests
3. **Logic Execution** → `Grid` performs calculations and updates state
4. **Visual Feedback** → `GameOfLifeUI` repaints the updated grid

## 🎯 Design Patterns Used

### **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:**
- **Model**: `Grid` + `CellState` (data and business logic)
- **View**: `GameOfLifeUI` (presentation layer)
- **Controller**: `GameOfLife` (mediates between model and view)

### **Observer Pattern:**
- UI components observe simulation state changes
- Real-time updates through repaint triggers

### **Strategy Pattern:**
- Different pattern generators (glider, blinker, pulsar)
- Extensible for additional patterns
