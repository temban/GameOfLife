# Conway's Game of Life Implementation

## üéÆ How the Game Works

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that evolves based on simple rules:

### Rules of the Game:
- **Any live cell** with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next generation
- **Any dead cell** with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)
- **All other cells** die or remain dead in the next generation

The simulation runs on an infinite two-dimensional grid where each cell interacts with its 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use the Application

### Controls Overview:

#### üéØ **Random Button**
- **Purpose**: Populates the grid with random live cells (approximately 30% density)
- **When to use**: Click **before starting** to create an initial random configuration
- **Effect**: Stops any running simulation and generates a new random pattern

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Start Button**
- **Purpose**: Begins the continuous simulation
- **When to use**: After setting up your initial pattern (via Random or manual drawing)
- **Note**: Becomes disabled while simulation is running

#### ‚èπÔ∏è **Stop Button**
- **Purpose**: Pauses the running simulation
- **When to use**: To pause and examine the current generation
- **Note**: Only enabled when simulation is active

#### ‚è≠Ô∏è **Step Button**
- **Purpose**: Advances the simulation by exactly one generation
- **When to use**: For precise control and observation of each generation
- **Note**: Only available when simulation is paused

#### üßπ **Clear Button**
- **Purpose**: Resets the entire grid to all dead cells
- **When to use**: To start fresh with a clean grid
- **Effect**: Stops simulation and clears all cells

#### üéöÔ∏è **Speed Slider**
- **Purpose**: Controls the simulation speed
- **Range**: From **Fast** (left) to **Slow** (right)
- **Real-time adjustment**: Can be changed during simulation

### üñ±Ô∏è Manual Cell Editing:
- **Click** on any cell to toggle its state (alive/dead)
- **Click and drag** to draw multiple cells
- Works even while simulation is running for interactive experimentation

## üé® Predefined Patterns

The application includes several famous Game of Life patterns:

### **Glider**
- A spaceship that moves diagonally across the grid
- Select from Patterns ‚Üí Glider menu

### **Blinker**
- An oscillator that alternates between horizontal and vertical states
- Period 2 oscillator

### **Pulsar**
- A complex period 3 oscillator with fascinating behavior
- One of the most well-known patterns in Game of Life
